    <br>
    <p>Are you an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys hiking, mountains, or both? Mt. Ophir stands at 1,276 meters (3/4 of a mile) and is known for being a popular hiking destination for tourists. This activity is sure to give you a great workout while providing beautiful scenery at the same time.
      When you decide to embark on this journey, it is important that you take a few essentials along the way. Items such as small snacks, water, a backup pair of shoes, a map for directions, and emergency contact information are key to enjoying your experience.</p>

    <br> 
    <p>Textiles are a pretty popular piece of clothing in Tangkak. Locals enjoy textiles so much that there is an abundance of them available (hence the name Textile Heaven). It is amazing to see how many unique designs and options there are. You can buy a few of them for yourself, or buy them for gifts for your loved ones.</p>

    <br>
    <h3 style="font-family:serif;">Picnic At Waterfalls</h3>
    <br>
    <img src="ttd4.jpg" width="550px" height="400px">
    <br> 
    <p>Non-adventure seekers can explore the Sagil waterfall, a favourite picnic spot or take a 20-minute hike to the splendid Puteri waterfalls. The walk is family friendly and safe. Lanes and steps have been cut out amid the dense forest. The waterfall is about 50m high and opens up to natural pools at the bottom. It is the perfect location to soak away your stress and bask in the nature wonders of the Gunung Ledang National Park.</p>
