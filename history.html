    <blockquote>
      <h5>Tangkak was established in 1901 at the foot of Mt. Ophir (1276m), 
        and was then under Muar district's <br> direct jurisdiction.  The local council was formed in 1946 and
         was administered by the Assistant District Officer, who reported to the Muar District Office at the time.</h5>
      <br>
      <br>
       <h5>Tangkak is said to have originated from the Malay term merangkak, which means "to creep." Long Mahmud is<br> thought to have led a 
        group of seven brothers from Indonesia's Riau Province to establish the first town, which is now known as Tangkak. 
        These seven brothers travelled from Riau Province, following the Kesang River till they arrived at Tangkak River.</h5>
      <br>
      <br>
       <h5>They noticed the flat ground and decided to stay put.Unfortunately, their legs were caught in the slick river mud,
         making it <br>impossible for them to climb up the river bank. They had to rely on tree roots to assist them get onto land. 
         When other settlers inquire about the location's name, they will respond with tang merangkak tu. 
         It was eventually abbreviated to Tangkak, which is the settlement's current name.</h5>
      <br>
      <br>
       <h5>This hamlet is connected to Gunung Ledang, a prominent mountain where legend has it that the most beautiful princess ever resided.
        The last Sultan of the Malacca Sultanate was so enamoured with this princess, <br>Puteri Gunung Ledang, 
        that he dispatched his finest warrior, Hang Tuah, to ask her for her hand in marriage.<br>
         Hang Tuah, legend or not, never returned to the mountain after his second visit.</h5>
